# Connecting Apple Thunderbolt Display (A1407) to Non-Apple Devices

The Apple Thunderbolt Display (A1407) was designed for macOS systems, but it can be used with certain non-Apple devices under specific conditions. This guide explains how to connect the display to PCs or laptops with Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB4 support.

## Basic Requirement

If your host device (PC or laptop) has Thunderbolt 3 support with an **Alpine Ridge controller**, it will work directly using a **Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter**. 

For **Titan Ridge-based Thunderbolt 3** or **Thunderbolt 4/USB 4** hosts, additional steps or hardware are required for a full connection. However, functionality may be limited on Windows systems, particularly for Thunderbolt 4 hosts, which may not support display output at all on Windows.

### Thunderbolt 4 Restriction
For **Thunderbolt 4 hosts**, display functionality may not work on Windows systems, even for single-display setups. However, the display is known to work on other non-Windows operating systems such as **Debian or other Linux-based systems**. If you're using a Windows system with a Thunderbolt 4 host, you may encounter issues when trying to connect the Apple Thunderbolt Display.

## Connection Methods

### 1. Using an Alpine Ridge-Based Thunderbolt 3 Dock
- **Dock Type**: Alpine Ridge-based Thunderbolt 3 Dock (JHL6540 or DSL6540).
- **Example**: Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock HD (available at low prices on eBay).
- **Setup**: Connect the dock to the host (PC or laptop) using a Thunderbolt 3 cable. From the dock, connect the Apple Thunderbolt Display using a **Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter** (required for all setups).
- **Functionality**: This method retains all functionalities of the display, such as:
  - Camera
  - USB Hub
  - Brightness Control
  
This method provides a seamless experience as though the display were connected to a macOS system.

### 2. Using a Thunderbolt Add-On Card (e.g., GC-Alpine Ridge)
- **Card Type**: Thunderbolt 3 PCIe add-on card (e.g., GC-Alpine Ridge).
- **Setup**: Install the PCIe card in your PC, then connect the DisplayPort (DP) or mini-DP output to the card. The card will output Thunderbolt 3 with the display signal.
  
  **Alternative Setup**: You can also use a **PCIe x1 to x16 riser** (commonly used in cryptocurrency mining) to connect the add-on card without needing to install it in an actual PC. This allows you to use the card externally with a simple PCIe power adapter.

- **Functionality**: 
  - **Note**: This method does not use any PCIe bandwidth, meaning you wonâ€™t get additional features like camera, USB hub, or brightness control. It only provides display output.

## Daisy Chaining Multiple Thunderbolt Displays

Some PCs and laptops support **multiple display outputs on a single Thunderbolt port**, allowing for Daisy Chain functionality with Thunderbolt Displays. This means you can connect multiple displays using a single Thunderbolt 3 port. However, certain systems do not support this feature (e.g., **ASROCK X570 ITX/TB3**).

## Compatibility Overview

| Host Type                                | Connection Method | Additional Hardware             | Display Functionality  | Special Notes |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Thunderbolt 3 (Alpine Ridge)**          | Direct Connection | TB3 to TB2 adapter              | Full (Camera, USB Hub, Brightness Control) | Works seamlessly |
| **Thunderbolt 3 (Titan Ridge)**           | Method 1: Dock     | TB3 Dock (Alpine Ridge-based)   | Full                   | Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock HD recommended |
|                                           | Method 2: Add-on   | PCIe Thunderbolt 3 card (GC-Alpine Ridge) + DP cable | Display Only            | No camera, USB hub, or brightness control |
| **Thunderbolt 4 / USB 4**                 | Method 1: Dock     | TB3 Dock (Alpine Ridge-based)   | Full (non-Windows OS)   | Works on **non-Windows OS** such as Debian; does not work on Windows for any display functionality |
|                                           | Method 2: Add-on   | PCIe Thunderbolt 3 card (GC-Alpine Ridge) + DP cable | Display Only (non-Windows OS) | Works on **non-Windows OS** only |
| **Daisy Chain Support**                   | Varies            | Depends on host capabilities    | Full (if supported)     | Not supported on all systems (e.g., ASROCK X570 ITX/TB3) |

## Additional Notes

- **Alpine Ridge vs. Titan Ridge**: 
  - **Alpine Ridge** controllers allow for direct compatibility with Thunderbolt 2 devices.
  - **Titan Ridge** and **Thunderbolt 4** hosts typically require a docking solution for full functionality due to their focus on compatibility with modern USB-C and Thunderbolt peripherals, which may require extra power or bandwidth allocation.
  
- **Used Hardware**: You can find Alpine Ridge-based Thunderbolt 3 docks (e.g., Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock HD) on eBay for lower prices, making them an economical solution.

## Conclusion

Connecting an Apple Thunderbolt Display (A1407) to non-Apple devices is possible with the right hardware. For hosts with Thunderbolt 3 (Alpine Ridge), a simple adapter is all you need. For Thunderbolt 3 (Titan Ridge), Thunderbolt 4, or USB4 hosts, using a Thunderbolt dock or PCIe add-on card will allow for compatibility, although some functionality may be limited depending on the method you choose.
